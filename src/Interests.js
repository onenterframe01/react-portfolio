    <p className="personal-information">I enjoy the outdoors and keeping fit. I try get a run in everyday and if not a run, a walk around the block. Spending time wth my friends and family is really important to me and try make time for that inbetween a busy work schedule. I have always been interested in tech and the online space and never miss an opportunity to read a good tech book or watch an online tutorial.</p>
